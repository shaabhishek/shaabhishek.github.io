I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the [Data to Actionable Knowledge (DtAK) lab](https://dtak.github.io/) at Harvard University, where I am advised by Finale Doshi-Velez. 

My research interests lie in probabilistic machine learning and decision-focused modeling, with a strong motivation from applications in healthcare. These interests allow me to take ideas from Optimization, Probabilistic Graphical Models, and Reinforcement Learning and apply them to important social problems. Before coming to Harvard, I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and my B.Tech. in Engineering from IIT Madras.
