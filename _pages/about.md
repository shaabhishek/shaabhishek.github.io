I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in the [Data to Actionable Knowledge (DtAK) lab](https://dtak.github.io/) at Harvard University, where I am advised by Finale Doshi-Velez.

My research focuses on reinforcement learning (RL) and representation learning for decision-making. I create models that are not only predictive but also align with important properties, such as interpretability and safety.

I have collaborated with hospitals (Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital) and the Singapore government (Temasek Laboratories) on applying machine learning to healthcare challenges. During my internship at Google, I worked on developing interpretable foundational models for waveform data. My PhD projects include creating interpretable and safe batch RL methods to improve clinician decisions. I have also applied my work to depression subtype discovery and disease progression modeling.

Before Harvard, I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and my B.Tech. in Engineering from IIT Madras.


<!-- My research interests lie in probabilistic machine learning and decision-focused modeling, with a strong motivation from applications in healthcare. These interests allow me to take ideas from Optimization, Probabilistic Graphical Models, and Reinforcement Learning and apply them to important social problems.  -->
